    <h1>Trie (Prefix Tree)</h1>
    <p>
      A Trie, also know as a Prefix Tree, is a tree-like data structure that
      stores a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually sequences, such
      as words. Each node in the Trie represents a character, and the path from
      the root to a particular node spell out a word. Trie structures are
      particularly useful for tasks involving dynamic sets of strings and are
      commonly used in applications like autocomplete systems

    <p><b>In a Trie</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each node of the Trie represents a character.</li>
      <li>The edges between nodes represent the links between characters</li>
      <li>The path from the root to a specific node forms a string</li>
      <li>
        Nodes may have links to other nodes representing the continuation of a
        string.
